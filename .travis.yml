# Collecting report files from a travis build to GCS requires setting the
# "CREDZ" and "REPORT_GCS_BUCKET" environment variables in your travis
# repository.
#
# The report bucket id should just be the bucket id without any scheme or path
# (e.g. "my-bucket-name", not "gcs://my-bucket-name").  You'll want to select
# "Display value in build log", otherwise travis will hide the bucket name in
# the URL that is displayed.
#
# The CREDZ variable should be the contents of a json credentials file for
# a service account with write access to the bucket, escaped for bash shell
# usage (usually just wrapping it in single quotes should suffice).
